## Seventeen

- Once upon a time at seventeen,
- I was in a hospital scene
- Broken bones and shattered dreams,
- A mess of blood and surgical seams.
- 
- My face once fair and full of grace,
- Now patched with steel and out of place.
- Lungs filled with blood, a life unknown,
- A nightmare of pain that I had flown.
- 
- The driver of the car, my dear friend
- Someone I loved, until the bitter end
- We lost each other in a haze of confusion
- And their guilt led to our ultimate conclusion
- 
- I struggle to understand why they were there
- What led us to that moment, so unfair
- The memories are hazy, shrouded in doubt
- But I know that day, our lives took a different route
- 
- Now, 37 years on, I am left with this pain
- And I wonder if our friendship was all in vain
- But I must forge ahead and live my life
- Despite the turmoil and ongoing strife
- 
- I may be misjudged, misunderstood, and feared
- But I am determined to persevere
- For I am not just a victim of that fateful day
- I am a survivor, in my own unique way.
