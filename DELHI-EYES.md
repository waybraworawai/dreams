### Toronto Nights, Delhi Eyes

In concrete canyons, neon bleeding,  
I roamed the twilight, a ghost barely breathing.  
Streets slick with rain, a city half-awake,  
These vacant sidewalks, my solace I'd take.  

```(Beat)```

No faces intruding, just shadows that danced,  
My symphony of solitude, a private trance.  
No eyes to judge, just the hum of the night,  
In these forgotten corners, I felt truly right.  

```(Beat)```  

Toronto, a canvas, I traced the unseen lines,  
A drifter, a dreamer, adrift in its signs.  
But the heart, it craves chaos, a different kind of light,  
So I crossed the wide ocean, to Delhi's foreign night.  

```(Beat)```  

An alleyway, hidden, a promise of hush,  
A doorway ajar, a world turned to dust.  
Or so I thought, naive Westerner's dream,  
For within, a thousand eyes, a vibrant, living stream.  

```(Beat)```  

Suddenly, I, the ghost, the unseen observer,  
Stood naked beneath a million-headed surveyor.  
Who am I, in this tapestry, this human sprawl?  
The invader, the outsider, standing oh so small.  

```(Beat)```  

"How dare I intrude," the frantic whisper arose,  
Lost in a culture where solitude rarely shows.  
Their eyes, a scorching sun, burning through disguise,  
Melting the mask I wore, revealing my own surprise.  

```(Beat)```  

Is there solace in shadows, or truth in the unseen?  
Is the self a mirage, a dream on a flickering screen?  
These Delhi streets echo a question profound,  
Who am I, truly, on this ever-shifting ground?
