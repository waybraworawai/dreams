In Montreal's dilapidated townhouse,  
Amidst dusty antiques on every floor,  
Strangers arrived to take them away,  
As I dwelled in the mess and the lore.  

They descended upon the townhouse,  
With family issues and tales to tell,  
And I, the outsider, the poor student,  
Living there, just to have a place to dwell.  

More and more arrived, each with their own,  
A personal attachment to some furniture shown,  
In a unit identical to one of old,  
Where memories and dreams unfold.  

Yet, I never ventured to the basement below,  
Where once my childhood bedroom did glow,  
Instead, content on the kitchen floor,  
I slept next to antiques, dusty and hoar.  

To most, I was invisible, a renter just there,  
Living amidst the antiques and the snare,  
But in that old townhouse, I found more,  
A place where childhood memories did soar.  

So, in the midst of life's noisy hum,  
Remember that Montreal townhouse,  
Where antiques and memories did come,  
And the outsider found a place to rouse.
